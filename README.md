- `main` branch contains production-ready code
- `development` branch is the primary branch for development
- Feature branches are created from `development` with the naming convention `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fixes are created with the naming convention `fix/bug-name`

### Contributing

1. Create a new branch from `development`

4. When viewing a post with multiple media, use the carousel navigation to browse through the files

## Deployment

2. Deploy the server directory to your preferred hosting service (e.g., Heroku, Render, Digital Ocean)

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the production version of the frontend
   ```
   cd client
   npm run build
